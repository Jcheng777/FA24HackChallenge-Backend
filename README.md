# FA24HackChallenge-Backend

Team 13

This is the backend for the Let em Cook app. It is coded in python utilizing SQLAlchemy and Flask.

BTW while we have athorization implemented, we were unable to deploy it in our main due to the frontend not having enough time to implement it yet (because of all the incredible screens they had to make), therefore the real authorization is fully implemented in the necessary routes in the "ashlie" branch.
